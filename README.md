Background Information
- CvbXStem is a growing stem cell treatment clinic. This project would consist of creating a website that would have a patient portal, for patients to contact their doctors through the portal (link to email or WhatsApp) and have access to any important forms they need to fill in. Then, we would need the admin portal, where admins/doctors could have access to all patient’s treatment information, be able to track a patient’s treatment process and be able to update it, send reminder emails or send forms to be completed.
